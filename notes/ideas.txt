Ideas

* For vertexes, have two byte arrays, one that stores the active vertexes and another for inactive.
** Do a merge sort on these two arrays when scanning through them.
* Replace the Edge with a MappedByteBuffer backed InputStream. Do we get a speed up?
* Switch to FileBackedOutputStream (and compliments) so small buffers are kept in memory.
